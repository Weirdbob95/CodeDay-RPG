You can instantly move between points in space. When you use this power, you instantly move to a location within 10 feet. Each rank of Teleport after the first doubles the distance you can travel. If you attempt to teleport to a location that is occupied by a creature or object, you take damage equal to (your Teleport rank * 2) and you do not move.
