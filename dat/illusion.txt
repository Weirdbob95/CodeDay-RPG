You can create seemingly real illusions. When you use this power, you create an illusion at a location within 100 feet for up to 1 hour. Illusions you create must fit inside a box with side length equal to (your Illusion rank * 5) feet. Your illusions cannot change their behavior or interact with things after they are created.

When a creature first pays attention to your illusion, it can make an Intelligence saving throw with DC equal to (10 + your Illusion rank / 2) to disbelieve the illusion. A creature can take an action to intensely study an illusion to make another saving throw. Creatures that have clear proof that something is an illusion automatically disbelieve it. Creatures that disbelieve an illusion can perceive both the illusion and anything the illusion hides.
